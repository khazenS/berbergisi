# ‚öôÔ∏è How to Setup
- First of all, you need to download Node.js and have a MongoDB account for database.
- The setup has 2 side server and client.
  
### ‚öôÔ∏è Server Side Setup
- You need to type a database name to server/database/dbConnection.js
- We are going to set .env file.
```sh
DB_URL=yourDatabaseUrl
PORT=3001
ENCRYPTION_DECRYPTION_KEY=yourCryptoKey
JWT_SECRET_QUE=queJWTsecret
VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=vapidPublic
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=vapidPrivate
RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=recaptcha
JWT_SECRET_VERIFIED_USER=verifiedUserJWTsecret  
```
Get your DB URL from MongoDB , PORT is 3001 as default , create VAPID keys for web push notification , reCAPTCHA key from Google Cloud.
After all of that you can determine crypto and jwt keys whatever you want.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Client Side Setup
- We are going to set .env file.
```sh
REACT_APP_ENCRYPTION_DECRYPTION_KEY=yourCryptoKey
REACT_APP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3001/api/
REACT_APP_JWT_SECRET_QUE=queJWTsecret
REACT_APP_VAPID_PUBLIC=vapidPublic
REACT_APP_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=recaptcha
```
Copy + Paste keys from server/.env except reCAPTCHA site that is another key from Google Cloud.

### üåê Start App
- Client works on 3000 port as a default and server works on 3001.
- We install our node modules and start for ui.
```sh
cd ui
npm i 
npm start
```
- We install our node modules and start for server.
```sh
cd server
npm i 
npm run start
```
- Enter 'http://localhost:3000/#/adminLogin' this url and type 'admin' for username and password.
